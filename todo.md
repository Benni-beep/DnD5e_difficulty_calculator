# difficulty calculation logic
- make logic use data from states
- output formatted result in browser
- handle empty party array

# components
- {CreatureSelector}:
  - handle click on decrement-button for elements that are not present in state
  - use table-heads for sorting entries, indicate via symbols in heads

- {Party}
  - add-button if not all PCs are of same level

# maybe
? increase accuracy further with more concrete data 
    - import character sheet data from foundry vtt
    - use hp/ac/dmg of character sheets and creature data for calculation instead of just CR
