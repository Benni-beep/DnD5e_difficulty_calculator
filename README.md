## D&D 5e combat difficulty calculator
This is an attempt to estimate the difficulty of combat encounters more accurately. It still uses the number of opponents and their levels/challange ratings as a base. Those are parsed into a new set of values before copmaring them to determine the difficulty.
The output is the same as in the classical encounter builder: "trivial", "easy", "medium", "hard", "deadly" or "absurd".

## use
- you can filter for specific creatures from the list and add or remove them using the buttons next to their names
- add a number of party members and set their level
